#include <iostream>

// dynamic memory = Memory that is allocated after the program
//                  is already compiled & running. Use the 'new'
//                  operator to allocate memory in the heap instead of stack
//
//                  Useful when we don't know how much memory we will need.
//                  Makes our programs more flexible, especially when accepting user input
